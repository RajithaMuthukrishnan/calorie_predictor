An application to predict the calories burned using inputs - Gender, Age, Height, Weight, Duraion and Heart rate (beats per minute). 
Multiple Machine and Deep Learning models were designed and the best performing model is used to predict the calories burned.

Model.ipynb - Machine and Deep learning models designed
app.py - Python file for the application (webpage)
templates/home.html - Webpage design
calorie_cal_run.py - Python script to automate package install, application hosting and webpage launch.

Note : 
1. Python 3.8 is a prerequisite
2. calorie_cal_run.py will install packages. Execute the script in virtual environment if required. 


**Execution command** : python caloie_cal_run.py
